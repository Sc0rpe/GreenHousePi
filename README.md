# GreenHousePi
This Project is from four students of the [Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg](https://tu-freiberg.de) in germany.
It was created for the subject "application of information and automizationsystems".
The goal of this project is to build an autonomous greenhouse with different features using a raspberry pi.

Desired features:
* Tracking of Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture and Light Intensity
* Ability to open the roof for cooling and ventilation
* Turning on the lights if the available light intensity is too low
* Ventilate with the Fan if the humidity is too high
* Water if the soil moisture is too low
* Ability to be operated over a backend
* Displaying values over a LCD-Screen

# Installation
1. Download the latest raspbian image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
    (light image because of performance recommended)
2. Install it
3. Run
	`sudo raspi-config` 
    and enable the I2C Interface under advanced options
5. Dowload the ghpi-library, therefore run 
    `git clone https://github.com/Sc0rpe/GreenHousePi`
6. Go into the folder ghpi and run
    `make main`
    Output will be a file ghpi.o
7. You can run it with
    `sudo ./ghpi.o`
8. If you want it to start after boot automaticaly add
    `./path/to/ghpi.o`
    to the end of the file /etc/rc.local

# Adding your own Sensor
1. Create a new class and inherit from `ghpi::Sensor`
2. Override the `Run` and `get_values` function
4. Create an instance of your class, create some instances of Pin for your device and register them using the `RegisterPin()` function
5. Register your instance to the Operator using `RegisterDevice()`
6. For better understanding have look at the `dht22.cpp` file
7. Don't forget to add your newly created file to the makefile for the main target, otherwise it won't be linked if your run `make main`

# Adding your own Actuator
1. Create a new class and inherit from `ghpi::Actuator`
2. Override `TurnOn` `TurnOff` `Toggle` and if needed the `Run` function 
3. Create instances of `ghpi::Action` and register the actions your Actuator can execute by using `RegisterAction()`
4. Connect them by registering them with a Constraint on the operater using `RegisterConstraint`
5. Don't forget to add your newly created file to the makefile for the main target, otherwise it won't be linked if your run `make main`
